This is my little repository of arduino snips.


Mainly for learning and hopefully to reach my goal to have:
- Arduino based home security system with alarm and integration to OpenWRT
- Arduino solar panel optimizer, sun follower
- Arduino on the boat as, anchor watch, security system, environment logger.


Code snipps
